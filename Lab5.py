This homework may need to use math library

You need to fix #TODO part to finish homework
test_number is your input
you can test number and output in terminal by following command:
"python Lab5.py (your number)"
Ex:python Lab5.py 97

#TODO part
'''
you need write 2 program(Ch03, page16)
1.Naive algorithm
2.Quick algorithm
In this 2 program, you need to print "test_number is prime" if your input is a prime number
and you need to print "not a prime number" if your input is not a prime number
Hint:'break' can help you finish program faster

Therefore, when you run "python Lab5.py 97", you should see the result is

97
test_number is prime
test_number is prime

Meanwhile, when you run "python Lab5.py 6", you should see the result is

6
not a prime number
not a prime number
